This service provides switchtimer aka reminder as a service for several skins.
Currently Aeon Flex from Kodinerds is supported (WIP) but other skins can this
service implement too.

No more forgotten football matches or formula one races! Avoid discussion with
your better half and let kodi switch to the channels you want! Or let they switch
to their favorite shows at given time!

This service must be supported by the skin. You need at least a button e.g. in the
context menu area of the PVR OSD Guide (e.g. DialogContextMenu.xml) of your skin
with the special code below. You need additional code for positioning and drawing
buttons of course, but that is skin specific.

<label>$ADDON[service.kn.switchtimer 30040]</label>
<visible>System.HasAddon(service.kn.switchtimer) + Window.IsVisible(tvguide)</visible>
<onclick>RunScript(service.kn.switchtimer,action=add,channel=$INFO[ListItem.ChannelName],icon=$INFO[ListItem.Icon],date=$INFO[ListItem.Date],title=$INFO[ListItem.Title])</onclick>

If you want buttons for deleting one or all timers just use

<onclick>RunScript(service.kn.switchtimer,action=del,timer=tx)</onclick>

where tx is a timer from t0 to t9, or delete all timers with

<label>$ADDON[service.kn.switchtimer 30041]</label>
<onclick>RunScript(service.kn.switchtimer,action=delall)</onclick>

Timers are stored as strings in the settings of the skin (guisettings.xml/skinsettings.xml)
as follows. Empty strings are inactive timers. All timers are sorted by datetime
where t0 is the nearest and t9 the latest timer.

t0:channel      # channel name
t0:icon         # channel icon
t0:date         # datetime of broadcast
t0:title        # title of broadcast
...
t9:channel
t9:icon
t9:date
t9:title

SwitchTimerActiveItems: # of active timers
