This service provides switchtimer aka reminder as a service for several skins.
Currently Aeon Flex from Kodinerds is supported (WIP) but other skins can this
service implement too.

No more forgotten football matches or formula one races! Avoid discussion with
your better half and let kodi switch to the channels you want!

You need at least a button e.g. in the context menu area of the PVR OSD Guide
(e.g. DialogContextMenu.xml) of your skin with the code below:

<visible>System.HasAddon(service.kn.switchtimer) + Window.IsVisible(tvguide)</visible>
<onclick>RunScript(service.kn.switchtimer,action=add,channel=$INFO[ListItem.ChannelName],icon=$INFO[ListItem.Icon],date=$INFO[ListItem.Date],title=$INFO[ListItem.Title])</onclick>

If you want buttons for deleting one or all timers just use

<onclick>RunScript(service.kn.switchtimer,action=del,timer=tx</onclick>

where tx is a timer from t0 to t9, or delete all timers with

<onclick>RunScript(service.kn.switchtimer,action=delall</onclick>

Timers are stored as strings in the settings of the skin as follows. Empty strings
are inactive timers.

t0:channel      # channel name
t0:icon         # channel icon
t0:date         # datetime of broadcast
t0:title        # title of broadcast
...
t9:channel
t9:icon
t9:date
t9:title
