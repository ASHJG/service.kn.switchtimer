No more forgotten football matches or formula one races! Avoid discussion with
your better half and let kodi switch to the channels you want! Or let they switch
to their favorite shows at a given time!

This service adds items to the context menu of the pvr osd guide window (PVROSDGuide)
automatically (add switchtimer, delete all switchtimer). Currently the skins Aeon Flex,
Destiny and a Confluence Mod from Kodinerds supports this service but other skins can 
this service implement too. Hints for integration see below here. If you aren't a skinner
just ignore the following and install this service as usual.

Skinners only:

If you want or need to call this service inside of another window different from 
PVROSDGuide, use:

<label>$ADDON[service.kn.switchtimer 30040]</label>
<visible>System.HasAddon(service.kn.switchtimer) + Window.IsVisible(tvguide)</visible>
<onclick>RunScript(service.kn.switchtimer,action=add,channel=$INFO[ListItem.ChannelName],icon=$INFO[ListItem.Icon],date=$INFO[ListItem.Date],title=$INFO[ListItem.Title])</onclick>

If you want buttons for deleting one or all timers just use:

<onclick>RunScript(service.kn.switchtimer,action=del,timer=tx)</onclick>

where tx is a timer from t0 to t9, or delete all timers with

<label>$ADDON[service.kn.switchtimer 30041]</label>
<onclick>RunScript(service.kn.switchtimer,action=delall)</onclick>

Timers are stored as strings in the settings of the skin (guisettings.xml/skinsettings.xml)
as follows. Empty strings are inactive timers. All timers are sorted by datetime
where t0 is the nearest and t9 the latest timer.

t0:channel      # channel name
t0:icon         # channel icon
t0:date         # datetime of broadcast
t0:title        # title of broadcast
...
t9:channel
t9:icon
t9:date
t9:title

SwitchTimerActiveItems: # of active timers
